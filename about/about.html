            <h3>my story</h3>
            I was born in a small coastal town near Rome, 
            Italy to classical musician parents,
            and began practicing musical instruments, performing and participating
            in competitions at a very young age. My&nbsp;fascination for technology dates to my earliest years as well: something I likely 
            inherited from my mother as she did from her father, an accomplished physics professor and engineer as well as an opera singer, like herself. 
            <br><br>
            In my early teenage years, I developed an interest in rhythm games (popular western titles 
            in the 2000s include Guitar Hero and Dance&nbsp;Dance Revolution), and quickly grew involved
            in a thriving open-source, community-driven game development scene where I gained my first 
            exposure to databases, scripting languages and software design more generally by prototyping various game mechanics and features while
            collecting and acting on community feedback and hosting game design discussions with other volunteer developers.
            <br><br>
            For over ten years I worked as a classical musician in solo, small&nbsp;ensemble and orchestral formations, 
            toured Italy with a local orchestra, and later on, studied music performance at the Conservatorio di Musica in Perugia, Italy 
            before deciding to break with family tradition and pursue an entirely personal interest in academic philosophy. This led me to the Katholieke Universiteit
            Leuven in Leuven, Belgium, where I took a particular interest in classes on formal logic 
            and analytic philosophy, and began formulating a plan to find a job with good career prospects where I could 
            do something I loved.
            <br><br>
            <h3>tech</h3>
            Software development combines my passion for technology with a love for learning, working with a team and clearly defined formal systems, 
            so moving to the United States and enrolling in a development bootcamp was the obvious next move. 
            Throughout Bloomtech's Backend Java program (developed with Amazon), I gained extensive enterprise backend and full-stack experience with Java, Spring, 
            the AWS product suite (AWS Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Cloudformation),
            HTML, CSS, Javacript and React. I'm currently enrolled in Cook&nbsp;Systems' FastTrack'D program, 
            where I continue to solidify my knowledge of enterprise full-stack software development with Java, Spring, JavaScript and Angular.
